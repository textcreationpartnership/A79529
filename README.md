#This was the word of the Lord which Iohn Camm, and Francis Howgill was moved to declare and write to Oliver Cromwell, who is named Lord-Protector: shewing the cause why they came to speak to him: and shewing that they came not to petition him for any thing, but for the welfare of Sion, and for the righteous seeds sake; and that those laws which were given forth by the will of man, may be taken away; that the law may go forth of Sion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem; and so the kingdoms of the world may become the kingdom of Christ.#
